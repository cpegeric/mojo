# Load data

`movies.json` is from [movies.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vega/vega-datasets/master/data/movies.json).   

`tr.py` transforms `movies.json` to `movies.csv`.  I wrote the very first line of the file and CoPilot filled
in the rest.  It simply works.

First line of `movies.csv` is cut and pasted into load.sql to create the table.  The rest of the file is the data.
